# Introduction #
Often applications need to be written for a multilingual audience. Therefore we must have a way
to easily make translations of our applications. Even though you know that your application will
not need any translation, it is still a good practice to keep the natural language strings away
from your application code. The internationalization (i18n) module will help you accomplish that
task.

The i18n module builds on the TMX (Translation Memory eXchange) format, which has become more or
less an industry standard for storing translation messages. It is a clear and simple, human
readable XML format. If XML is a curse word to you, don't worry, this module will provide you with
a tool for creating and maintaining your translation file, just to ease your pain.

# Architecture #
The core of this module is the InternationalizationServlet. It is an HttpServlet which reads you
translation file into memory at startup and serves the application message translations in a
static way. The module also contains a FieldTranslation-annotation which can be used in combination
with the TranslationUtil to easily keep track of field name translations in your application. A
Lang utility class is also provided. The application instance should define the used locale in the
Lang class.

# About the translation messages #
Your translation messages are plain text messages in your translations file(s). Each translation
message is called a "translation unit" or "tu". Each unit has a unique identifier, called "tuid".
The translation unit consists of a number of translation unit variants ("tuv") where each tuv stands
for the translation of a message for a specific language. A simple translation unit in the
translation file could look like this

```
<tu tuid="GENERIC_USERNAME">
	<tuv lang="en">
		<seg>Username</seg>
	</tuv>
	<tuv lang="fi">
		<seg>Käyttäjätunnus</seg>
	</tuv>
	<tuv lang="se">
		<seg>Användarnamn</seg>
	</tuv>
</tu>
```

In this translation unit, we've translated the generic string "username" into three different
languages, English, Finnish and Swedish. Often our messages need to be dynamic, in other words, we
want to change some of the content of the translation depending on some variable in the application.
A common example could be a welcoming message which is shown after a user is logged in.

```
<tu tuid="WELCOME_MESSAGE">
	<tuv lang="en">
		<seg>Welcome {0}, your last login was {1}</seg>
	</tuv>
	<tuv lang="fi">
		<seg>Tervetuloa {0}, edellinen kirjautumisesi oli {1}</seg>
	</tuv>
	<tuv lang="se">
		<seg>Välkommen {0}, din senaste inloggning var {1}</seg>
	</tuv>
</tu>
```

This generic message contains two parameters which are identified by the a number between curly
brackets. These parameters will be replaced with the actual values when the user fetches the
translated message from the servlet.

# Importing the i18n module to your project #
The i18n module depends on the XOM XML parser, start by downloading the newest version of the
parser at http://www.xom.nu/. Once you downloaded the parser, include the xom.jar package in your
application's WEB-INF/lib -folder.

Next you will need to add the jar for the i18n module to you WEB-INF/lib folder. Just drop the
prebuilt package into your WEB-INF/lib-folder.

# Creating the translation files #
First, you'll need to create your translation files. The i18n module supports the usage of
multiple translation files, so it is up to you how you divide your translations into different
files. You can put all your translations in one file or, for example, create a separate
translation file for every language in your application.

To be able to use the maintenance tool provided by this module, your translation file needs
to contain the TMX stub. The following four rows will suffice as the initial content of the file:

```
<tmx version="1.4">
	<body>
	</body>
</tmx>
```

# Configuring the i18n module #
You'll only need to do three things to get the module up and running. The first task is to
register the servlet in our web.xml -file. It can be done by adding the following rows to
your web.xml -file:

```
<servlet>
	<servlet-name>I18NServlet</servlet-name>
	<servlet-class>org.vaadin.appfoundation.i18n.InternationalizationServlet</servlet-class>
	<load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
	<servlet-name>I18NServlet</servlet-name>
	<url-pattern>/I18NServlet/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```


The second task is to load your translations files' content to the InternationalizationServlet.
This can be done by calling the `loadTranslations()` method in the servlet. The method takes
as input a `File` object. A good practice is to call this method in the application's context
listener.

Finally, you'll need to initialize the Lang class for your application instance.

```
public class YourApplication extends Application {
        @Override
        public void init() {
                Lang.initialize(this);
                Lang.setLocale(Locale.ENGLISH);            
                ...
        }
}
```

Once you've done this, you're ready to go!

# Maintaining your translations file #

The i18n module comes with a tool that will help you keep your translations files up to date.
The class FillXml contains a method named `updateTranslations()`. You provide the method
three parameters: a pointer to the translations file, an array of available languages and a
list of all available identifiers (tuids). The method will then read your translations file,
parse through it and check which translations unit ids are present. If the file is missing any
translation units for any of the tuids provided as the methods parameter, the method will add
the translation unit stub for that identifier and for all the provided languages. The default
translation for all stubs is "TODO", it is then up to you to replace all the TODOs with their
corresponding translations. The FillXml class will also look for missing languages, so if you
already have an existing translations file, but you want to add another language to it, just call
the `updateTranslations()` method with the new language.

# Usage #
The servlet only has one public method (excluding init) for the developer to use and that method
is `getMessage()`. As the name implies, `getMessage()` returns a translated message for
the user. The method takes in three parameters: The target language, the translation unit id and
any possible parameters for the the translation message. The method will return a translated
message in your given target language.

Example
```
String message = InternationalizationServlet.getMessage("en","WELCOME_MESSAGE","John Doe","today at 12:20 pm");
```

The message's value would now be "Welcome John Doe, your last login was today at 12:20 pm".

The FieldTranslation is a simple tool for keep track of the field translations in your classes.
Consider a User class which contains three fields: username, email and real name. Your object
might look something like this

```
public class User {
  ...
  private String username;

  private String realName;

  private String email;
  ...
}
```

If we create a Vaadin Form object with a User object, the fields would get the default captions
"Username", "Real name" and "Email", which is probably what we would want them to be, the problem
is that the captions are not translated, meaning that if your application is otherwise in Spanish,
the captions would still be in English.

We can solve this problem in a generic way by using the FieldTranslation annotation. The
annotation is added right above the field and the "tuid" parameter is defined. The tuid-parameter
is the translation unit id for the translation message in your translations file. The
resulting class could look like this:

```
public class User {
  ...
  @FieldTranslation(tuid = "USERNAME")
  private String username;

  @FieldTranslation(tuid = "REAL_NAME")
  private String realName;

  @FieldTranslation(tuid = "EMAIL")
  private String email;
  ...
}
```

We've now defined translations for the fields. What we now need to do is to link these
translations to the creation of the fields in your form. This is done by modifying your
FormFieldFactory slightly.

```
public class YourFieldFactory extends DefaultFieldFactory {
  ...
  public Field createField(Item item, Object propertyId,
                Component uiContext) {
    Field field = super.createField(item, propertyId, uiContext);
    ...
    // Use the TranslationUtil to get the traslated name for 
    // your field
    field.setCaption(TranslationUtil.getFieldTranslation(
                    YourClass.class, (String) propertyId));
    ...
    return field;
}
```

The TranslationUtil's `getFieldTranslation()` method will look for the field `propertyId`
in the YourClass-class. If the field is found, the TranslationUtil will check for the presence of
the FieldTranslation-annotation. If the annotation is present, the tuid is read and the
translation message is fetched via the InternationalizationServlet. If a translation message is
not defined, then the default caption is used.

Use the Lang utility class for storing an application instance's locale. This is simply done by
calling

```
Lang.setLocale(Locale.FRENCH);
```

The Lang class also contains a wrapper method for the InternationalizationServlet's
`getMessage` method. The Lang's wrapper method looks otherwise like the servlet's method, with
the exception that you do not need to specify the translation message's language, as the language
is taken from the utility's internal locale (the one set with `Lang.setLocale`).

```
String username = Lang.getMessage("USERNAME");
```
